> A portmanteau of Aletheia and encyclopedia, the Alethopedia is a menagerie of projects I want to share with you, the reader. My only hope is that you find some interest in the things I find slightly more amusing than mere existence. For more extra details, you can find most of my code on [GitHub](https://github.com/JamesRCr).
